I am a software developer with **11** years of experience in commercial software development.
I am interested in micro-optimizations (SIMD, JIT, LLVM), mobile applications (Android, iOS, Xamarin) and game development (a bit of Unity).

**Microsoft** (2016 - now)  
Currently working on .NET 5 (from Mono side). Also, I contribute to [CoreCLR](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=author%3AEgorBo+) and [CoreFX](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=author%3AEgorBo+).

**Xamarin** (2015 - 2016)  
Worked on [UrhoSharp](https://github.com/xamarin/urho). Joined Mono team.

**Freelance, pet projects** (2014 - 2015)  
A bit of Java, a bit of C++. 

**Playtika** (2013 - 2014)  
Developed casino-like games for mobile platforms using Xamarin.  
Not something I am proud of.

**Viber**   (2012 - 2013)  
Developed [Viber](https://www.viber.com/), a mobile messaging and calling app, for Windows Phone 7-8.  
I miss WP7, seriously.
